# ShadowTraffic Data Configuration

This directory contains the complete ShadowTraffic data configuration for the River Hotels workshop, including generators, schemas, connections, and the main configuration file. The setup uses ShadowTraffic's modular approach with the [`loadJsonFile` feature](https://docs.shadowtraffic.io/functions/loadJsonFile/) for maintainable and reusable data generation.

## Configuration Files

### Main Configuration

- **`shadow-traffic-configuration.json`** - Orchestrates all generators using a three-stage approach: seed data → historical data → streaming data
- **`shadow-traffic-license.env`** - Contains ShadowTraffic license environment variables (auto-generated by Terraform)

### Terraform-Managed Files

Several critical files are automatically generated and destroyed by Terraform during infrastructure provisioning:

#### Auto-Generated Files

- **`connections/oracle.json`** - Oracle database connection with dynamic host IP and credentials
- **`connections/confluent.json`** - Confluent Cloud connection with API keys, bootstrap servers, and schema registry URLs
- **`shadow-traffic-license.env`** - ShadowTraffic license downloaded from GitHub

#### Why Terraform Management?

These files require numerous resource values and IDs from other Terraform-managed cloud resources (AWS instances, Confluent clusters, API keys, etc.) that need to be dynamically interpolated. Rather than requiring manual configuration with complex resource references, Terraform automatically:

1. **Generates** these files during `terraform apply` with proper resource interpolation
2. **Destroys** these files during `terraform destroy` for clean teardown
3. **Updates** connection details if infrastructure changes

This approach eliminates manual configuration errors and ensures the ShadowTraffic configuration always has current, valid connection information from the actual provisioned resources.

## Generators

### Data Source Generators

#### Oracle Database Generators

- **`customer_generator.json`** - Generates 1,000 customer records with contact information
- **`hotel_generator.json`** - Generates 30 hotel properties across 9 countries with amenities and descriptions

#### Kafka Topic Generators

- **`clickstream_generator_historical.json`** - Generates 3,000 historical website interaction events over the past 8 weeks
- **`clickstream_generator_streaming.json`** - Produces real-time clickstream events every 10-15 seconds
- **`booking_generator_historical.json`** - Generates 400 historical booking records with realistic date relationships
- **`booking_generator_streaming.json`** - Produces streaming booking events every 45-60 seconds
- **`review_generator_historical.json`** - Generates 200 historical hotel reviews with rating-based text selection
- **`review_generator_streaming.json`** - Produces streaming reviews every 100-150 seconds with intelligent review text matching

### Review Text Resources

Rating-specific review text files ensure sentiment matches numeric ratings:

- **`review_text_choices_1_star.json`** - Very bad experiences (10% frequency)
- **`review_text_choices_2_star.json`** - Somewhat bad experiences (20% frequency)
- **`review_text_choices_3_star.json`** - OK experiences (30% frequency)
- **`review_text_choices_4_star.json`** - Pretty good experiences (25% frequency)
- **`review_text_choices_5_star.json`** - Great experiences (15% frequency)

## Schemas

Avro schema files define the structure for Kafka topics and ensure type safety:

### `booking_schema.avsc`

Defines the booking event structure with fields:

- `BOOKING_ID`, `CUSTOMER_EMAIL`, `HOTEL_ID`
- `CHECK_IN`, `CHECK_OUT`, `OCCUPANTS`, `PRICE`
- `CREATED_AT` (with Flink timestamp precision)

### `clickstream_schema.avsc`

Defines website interaction events with fields:

- `ACTIVITY_ID`, `CUSTOMER_EMAIL`, `HOTEL_ID`
- `ACTION`, `EVENT_DURATION`, `URL`
- `CREATED_AT` (with Flink timestamp precision)

### `review_schema.avsc`

Defines hotel review events with fields:

- `REVIEW_ID`, `BOOKING_ID`
- `REVIEW_RATING`, `REVIEW_TEXT`
- `CREATED_AT` (with Flink timestamp precision)

## Connections

The `connections/` directory contains auto-generated connection files managed by Terraform:

### Connection Files

- **`oracle.json`** - Oracle database connection for customer and hotel data with dynamic AWS EC2 instance details
- **`confluent.json`** - Confluent Cloud connection for Kafka topic streaming with live API keys and cluster endpoints

### Terraform Integration

These connection files are automatically managed through the Terraform lifecycle:

```hcl
# Example from data_generator.tf
resource "local_file" "oracle_connection_config" {
  content = jsonencode({
    kind: "oracle"
    connectionConfigs: {
      host: "${aws_instance.oracle_instance.public_ip}"
      port: "${var.oracle_db_port}"
      # ... other dynamic values
    }
  })
  filename = "../data/connections/oracle.json"
}
```

#### Benefits

- **Dynamic Values**: Automatically includes actual resource IDs, IPs, and API keys from provisioned infrastructure
- **No Manual Updates**: Connection details stay current as infrastructure changes
- **Clean Lifecycle**: Files are created during `terraform apply` and removed during `terraform destroy`
- **Error Prevention**: Eliminates manual transcription errors between Terraform outputs and ShadowTraffic configuration

## Key Features

### Advanced Data Generation

- **Variable-based Date Logic**: Booking generators ensure `CHECK_OUT` is 2-5 days after `CHECK_IN`
- **Realistic Booking Patterns**: Historical bookings created 2-21 days before `CHECK_IN`
- **Cross-Generator References**: Reviews reference actual booking IDs through lookups
- **Customer Behavior Modeling**: 80% of activities/bookings from repeat customers
- **Timestamp Formatting**: All date fields use proper formatting with `decimals: 0`

### Rating-Based Review System

- **Sentiment-Rating Alignment**: Each rating (1-5 stars) has dedicated text files with matching sentiment
- **Realistic Distribution**: Weighted frequencies create believable customer feedback patterns
- **Switch-Based Selection**: Intelligent text selection based on numeric rating values

## Rating-Based Review Text System

The review generators implement a sophisticated rating-based text selection system:

### Rating Scale Implementation

| Rating | Sentiment | Frequency | Example Language |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| 1 Star | Very bad experiences | 10% | "absolutely dreadful", "complete disaster", "appalling standards" |
| 2 Stars | Somewhat bad experiences | 20% | "disappointing aspects", "didn't quite match expectations" |
| 3 Stars | OK experiences | 30% | "perfectly adequate", "met basic expectations" |
| 4 Stars | Pretty good experiences | 25% | "very pleasant stay", "exceeded expectations" |
| 5 Stars | Great experiences | 15% | "exceptional", "outstanding", "exceeded all expectations" |

#### Distribution Notes

- **Consistent across generators**: Both historical and streaming use identical frequency distributions
- **Realistic pattern**: 4-star reviews (25%) more common than perfect 5-star reviews (15%)
- **Balanced spectrum**: Covers full range from very negative to exceptional experiences

### Technical Implementation

```json
"varsOnce": {
    "oneStarTexts": { "_gen": "loadJsonFile", "file": "review_text_choices_1_star.json" },
    "twoStarTexts": { "_gen": "loadJsonFile", "file": "review_text_choices_2_star.json" }
    // ... (3-5 star text files loaded once)
},
"value": {
    "REVIEW_RATING": {
        "_gen": "weightedOneOf",
        "choices": [
            { "weight": 10, "value": 1 },
            { "weight": 20, "value": 2 }
            // ... (weights 30, 25, 15 for ratings 3, 4, 5)
        ],
        "avroHint": { "type": "int" }
    },
    "REVIEW_TEXT": {
        "_gen": "weightedOneOf",
        "choices": [
            { "weight": 10, "value": { "_gen": "oneOf", "choices": { "_gen": "var", "var": "oneStarTexts" }}},
            { "weight": 20, "value": { "_gen": "oneOf", "choices": { "_gen": "var", "var": "twoStarTexts" }}}
            // ... (matching weights for 3-5 star texts)
        ],
        "avroHint": { "type": "string" }
    }
}
```

## Data Generation Stages

1. **Stage 0: Configuration**
   1. The `shadow-traffic-configuration.json` file contains a three-sequential-stage approach to generate both a batch of historical data and periodic ongoing streaming data
   2. Connections to Oracle and Confluent Cloud are prebuilt
2. **Stage 1: Seed Data (Oracle Database)**
   1. The `customer_generator` creates 10,000 customer records with timestamps of 10 weeks ago
   2. The `hotel_generator` creates 30 hotel records across 9 countries with timestamps of 10 weeks ago
3. **Stage 2: Historical Data (Kafka Topics)**
   1. **Clickstream Generator (Historical)** - Generates 5,000 clickstream events with random timestamps over the past 8 weeks
   2. **Booking Generator (Historical)** - Generates 500 booking records with random timestamps over the past 8 weeks
   3. **Review Generator (Historical)** - Generates 200 hotel reviews with random timestamps over the past 8 weeks
4. **Stage 3: Streaming Data (Kafka Topics)**
   1. **Clickstream Generator (Streaming)** - Produces messages every 9-14 seconds to the `clickstream` topic with a maximum of 100 events
      - References customer emails and hotel IDs from Oracle data
      - 80% of clickstream activity come from existing customers, 20% from anonymous users
   2. **Booking Generator (Streaming)** - Produces messages every 42-59 seconds to the `bookings` topic with a maximum of 30 events
      - Ensures that 20% of customers never appear in bookings
      - References customer emails and hotel IDs from Oracle data
   3. **Review Generator (Streaming)** - Produces messages every 10-15 seconds to the `hotel_reviews` topic up to a max of 15 events
      - Ensures all reviews have ratings between 3-5
      - References booking IDs from historical bookings data
