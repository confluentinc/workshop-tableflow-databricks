    "Our stay was absolutely dreadful from start to finish. The room was filthy with stained carpets, the air conditioning didn't work, and the staff was completely unhelpful when we complained about the numerous issues.",
    "This hotel is a complete disaster. The location might seem convenient, but the constant noise from construction and traffic made sleep impossible. We couldn't wait to leave.",
    "The room was a nightmare - broken fixtures, mold in the bathroom, and furniture that looked like it hadn't been replaced in decades. The views were of a parking lot and dumpster area.",
    "Staff attitude was shocking throughout our stay. Rude at check-in, dismissive of our complaints, and seemed annoyed whenever we asked for basic assistance. Customer service was non-existent.",
    "The hotel's ambience was depressing and run-down. Flickering lights in the lobby, torn wallpaper, and a general sense of neglect everywhere. It felt unsafe and unwelcoming.",
    "Dining was a complete catastrophe. The food was cold, tasteless, and appeared to have been sitting out for hours. We got food poisoning and couldn't enjoy the rest of our trip.",
    "Cleanliness standards were absolutely appalling. Hair in the sink, dirty towels, and what appeared to be previous guests' belongings still in the room. Housekeeping was clearly inadequate.",
    "Terrible value for money. We paid premium prices for what felt like a condemned building. Every aspect of the stay was disappointing and far below acceptable standards.",
    "The beds were lumpy and uncomfortable with springs poking through. Combined with paper-thin walls and noisy neighbors, we got no sleep during our entire stay.",
    "Concierge service was useless and unhelpful. They provided wrong information about local attractions and seemed completely uninterested in helping guests have a positive experience.",
    "The hotel's design was outdated and poorly maintained. Everything felt broken or about to break. The elevator was out of order half the time we were there.",
    "Breakfast was inedible - stale bread, spoiled fruit, and coffee that tasted like it was made yesterday. The dining area was dirty and uninviting.",
    "Technology was completely unreliable. No WiFi in the rooms, phones didn't work, and the TV had three working channels. It felt like staying in the 1980s.",
    "The rooftop area was closed due to 'maintenance' but looked like it had been neglected for years. Broken furniture and debris everywhere made it completely unusable.",
    "Spa facilities were dirty and poorly maintained. The pool water was murky, equipment was broken, and the whole area felt unhygienic and unsafe.",
    "Business facilities were a joke. Computers didn't work, printers were broken, and meeting rooms were stuffy with no proper ventilation or working equipment.",
    "The hotel showed no consideration for the environment or guests. Wasteful practices, no recycling, and seemed to care only about cutting costs at every corner.",
    "Family facilities were dangerous and inappropriate. Play areas were broken, no safety measures, and staff seemed irritated by children rather than welcoming to families.",
    "Fitness center was completely unusable. Broken equipment, poor ventilation, and felt like a health hazard. We couldn't even access half the advertised facilities.",
    "Entertainment was non-existent and the few events they had were poorly organized and boring. The hotel seemed to put no effort into guest satisfaction or enjoyment."
