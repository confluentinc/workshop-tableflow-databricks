    "The room was smaller than expected with a limited view of the courtyard. While clean, the decor felt tired and the bathroom fixtures showed signs of age and wear.",
    "Staff members were polite but seemed overwhelmed and unable to address our concerns promptly. Check-in took longer than expected and room service was slow to respond.",

    "Dining options were limited and overpriced for the quality provided. The breakfast selection was basic and food temperature was inconsistent, though the service was adequate.",
    "While the hotel appeared clean, attention to detail was lacking. Minor maintenance issues in the room and common areas suggested deferred upkeep and maintenance.",
