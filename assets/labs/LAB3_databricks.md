## üë£ Steps

### Step 1: Create Local Tables Sourced from S3 Delta Tables

You'll connect your streaming Delta tables from Confluent Tableflow to Databricks for analytics and AI processing.

#### Get S3 URIs from Confluent Tableflow

First, find the S3 URIs with these steps:

1. Navigate to the *Topics* page
2. Click on one of your Tableflow-enabled topics, like `DENORMALIZED_HOTEL_BOOKINGS`
3. Click on the *Monitor* tab
4. Find the *Tableflow details* tile and expand it
5. Click the *copy* icon next to the the *Storage Location* and use in the next section

   ![Tile showing the Storage Location of the S3 Delta Lake table](../images/confluent_tableflow_monitoring.png)

#### Source Tableflow Topics into Databricks as External Tables

1. Login to your Databricks workspace
2. Click on *SQL Editor* in the left navigation
3. Select the appropriate **catalog** and **database** in the editor dropdown. For those using trial or free accounts, this will likely be `workspace` and `default` respectively
4. Replace the placeholder values `<< >>` in the code block below with the actual values. Copy and paste the Delta table storage location in S3 that you copied previously from Confluent Cloud

```sql
CREATE TABLE <<table_name>>
    USING DELTA
LOCATION '<<S3 URI from Tableflow>>';
```

> [!TIP]
> **Case Insensitive Table Names**
>
> It appears that Databricks lowercases all table names, so you can paste them in from Confluent Cloud as all uppercase but they will display as all lowercase.

5. Verify the table was created successfully.  If not, review the [Databricks troubleshooting guide](./troubleshooting.md#databricks) for help.

6. Review the table schema by expanding the table in the *Catalog explorer*

   ![Table schema in databricks](../images/databricks_catalog_table_schema.png)

7. Open a new SQL editor tab and repeat the steps under the [*Get S3 URIs from Confuent Tableflow*](#get-s3-uris-from-confuent-tableflow) and the preceding steps 1-6 for the `clickstream` topic

8. Run this query to see if data is available

```sql
SELECT * FROM <<table_name>> LIMIT 20;
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Data Sync Delay**
>
> It may take 5-10 minutes for the above `SELECT` queries to return data in the results.
> The next big step requires that all data be
>
> ![Empty result set](../images/databricks_sql_editor_query_no_rows.png)
>
> You can review the [notebook](../resources/river_hotel_targeted_marketing_ai_agent.ipynb) containing the Agentic workflow you will implement while you wait for the data to arrive.

### Step 2: Generate Hotel Stats Table

With River hotel streaming topic data now (or soon) available in your Databricks account, you can generate an additional enriched dataset of aggregated metrics for each hotel.

Open a new query window and execute this statement to create a table that calculates high-level metrics at the hotel level.

```sql
CREATE TABLE hotel_stats AS (
SELECT
COALESCE(HOTEL_ID, 'UNKNOWN_HOTEL') AS HOTEL_ID,
HOTEL_NAME,
HOTEL_CITY,
HOTEL_COUNTRY,
HOTEL_DESCRIPTION,
HOTEL_CLASS,
SUM(1) AS TOTAL_BOOKINGS_COUNT,
SUM(GUEST_COUNT) AS TOTAL_GUEST_COUNT,
SUM(BOOKING_AMOUNT) AS TOTAL_BOOKING_AMOUNT,
CAST( AVG(REVIEW_RATING) AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) AS AVERAGE_REVIEW_RATING,
SUM(CASE WHEN REVIEW_RATING IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REVIEW_COUNT
FROM `denormalized_hotel_bookings`
WHERE HOTEL_ID IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
   HOTEL_ID,
   HOTEL_NAME,
   HOTEL_CITY,
   HOTEL_COUNTRY,
   HOTEL_DESCRIPTION,
   HOTEL_CLASS
);
```

Now run this query to see this data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM hotel_stats;
```

Some key observations about this data:

- Several cities and countries have multiple hotels with varying performance metrics
- The aggregated data provides real-time insights into booking patterns and customer satisfaction

### Step 3: Derive Data Product Insights with Genie

Databricks Genie makes it more accessible and easier to obtain data insights.  It provides a chat interface where you ask questions about your data in natural language, and it leverages generative AI to parse your questions and answer them through SQL queries it generates.

#### Set Up Genie Workspace

Follow these steps to set Genie up:

1. Click on the *Genie* link under the *SQL* section in the left sidebar
2. Click on the *+ New* button in the top right of the screen to create a new Genie space
3. Click on the *All* toggle
4. Navigate to your workshop *catalog* and *database* (e.g. `workspace` and `default`)
5. Select all three of the `clickstream`, `denormalized_hotel_bookings`, and `hotel_stats` tables

   ![Databricks Genie connect to data sources](../images/databricks_genie_connect_data.png)

6. Click on the *Create* button
7. Rename your space to something like *River Hotel BI*
8. Your space should look similar to this:

   ![Databricks Genie space](../images/databricks_genie_space.png)

#### Generate Business Insights

Prompt Genie for insights about the data using natural language and following these steps:

> [!NOTE]
> **Example Screenshots**
>
> Throughout these next steps of prompting insights from Genie, the results depicted in the screenshots are **only examples** - the dataset
> you generate for this lab is different each time, and so these example screenshots will never fully match what you see.

Click the **Explain the data set** button to generate an output similar to this:

![Databricks Genie prompt to explain data set](../images/databricks_genie_prompt_explain_dataset.png)

Now, find out how each country is doing with customer satisfaction with this prompt:
> Show me customer satisfaction metrics by country

You may see a table and chart similar to this:
![Databricks Genie sample user prompt](../images/databricks_genie_prompt_satisfaction_by_country.png)

You can dive into customer-centric analysis with this prompt:
> Show me customers who viewed hotels in the most cities

You should see a result similar to this:

![Table of customers](../images/databricks_genie_prompt_customers_hotels_viewed.png)

Another prompt to try out is this:
> Which cities had the most interest from customers?

See which cities top your list, it may look similar to this:

![table and chart of cities with the most interest](../images/databricks_genie_prompt_cities_customer_interest.png)

You may continue with your own prompts or clicking on Genie-suggested ones to further learn from the data.

Executing this final prompt will provide the *class* of hotel that you will use to fulfill the Marketing weekly discount campaign:

> Which class of hotel had the lowest interest from customers?

![Result set showing hotel class and corresponding customer interest count](../images/databricks_genie_prompt_hotel_class.png)

Identify the *Hotel Class* with the lowest customer interest, you will use this in the next section to create an intelligent marketing agent.

### Step 4: Create Marketing Campaign Agent

In this section you will use a provided Jupyter Notebook to generate an AI agent that will automatically identify hotels that need promotion and create targeted marketing campaigns for them!

The AI agent combines three intelligent functions:

1. **Hotel Selection**: Automatically identifies the lowest-performing hotel in a given class that has above-average customer satisfaction (3+ reviews) - perfect candidates for promotion
2. **Content Generation**: Uses AI to analyze customer reviews and extract the top 3 reasons guests enjoyed their stay, then creates positive social media posts highlighting these strengths
3. **Customer Targeting**: Identifies customers who showed high interest (many page views/clicks) but made few bookings in that hotel class - prime targets for conversion

#### Get SQL Warehouse ID

Your *SQL Warehouse ID* is needed for the Notebook. Follow these steps to retrieve it:

1. Click on *SQL Warehouses* in the left panel
2. Click on the warehouse where you want to execute this Notebook. If you are on a *trial* or *free edition* account, then click on the default *Serverless Starter Warehouse*
3. Copy the ID next to the *Name* field

    ![Databricks serverless warehouse configuration screen](../images/databricks_warehouse_id.png)

#### Import and Configure Notebook

Follow these steps to import and use a pre-built Notebook to generate your AI Agent:

1. Click on the light-red *+ New* button in the top left of the screen
2. Select *Notebook*
3. Select *File* and then *Import*
4. Upload [this file](../resources/river_hotel_targeted_marketing_ai_agent.ipynb)
5. Click on the *Import* button

   ![Import dialog with Notebook selected](../images/databricks_import_notebook.png)

6. Click on the Notebook name in the success modal to navigate to it, or find it using the *Search* bar at the top of the page

#### Execute AI Agent

Now that you have successfully imported the Notebook, Fill out these widget fields at the top of the notebook with appropriate values for your Databricks account.

Here is an example:

- **catalog:** `workspace`
- **database:** `default`
- **warehouse_id:** `77ad79eadc0d123`
- **hotel_class:** `Extended Stay`
- **hotel_to_promote**: ` `
  - Leave this one blank until later in the notebook

Start with the first cell and execute each one in succession, reading through the comments and executing the code. The notebook will guide you through:

1. **Creating SQL Functions**: Three user-defined functions that serve as tools for the AI agent
2. **Building the AI Agent**: Using LangChain and Databricks LLM endpoints to create an intelligent agent
3. **Executing the Marketing Campaign**: Running the agent to automatically identify a hotel, create marketing content, and generate a prospective customer list

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Follow Notebook Comments**
>
> Follow the instructions in the Notebook that appear as commented out text, as they help guide you through it.

At the end you should get an output that includes:

- The name and location of the selected hotel to promote
- A positive social media marketing post highlighting the hotel's best features
- A list of 10 customer email addresses who are prime targets for the campaign

Here is an example output:
