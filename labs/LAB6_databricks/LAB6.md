### Prerequisites

- Completed [LAB 5: Stream Processing](../LAB5_stream_processing/LAB5.md) with enriched data products flowing to Delta Lake tables

## 👣 Steps

### Step 1: Explore Streaming Data in Unity Catalog

Now that both raw and enriched data is flowing from Confluent via Tableflow to Databricks Unity Catalog, you can do some deep analysis and capture insights from it.

First, follow these steps to verify that the data is flowing in as expected:

1. Navigate to your Databricks account in your web browser
2. Click on **Catalog** in the left menu
3. Verify that you see a catalog with *tableflow-databricks* in it, it should look something like this:

   ![Databricks Catalog explorer](./images/databricks_catalog.png)

4. Click to expand your *tableflow-databricks* catalog
5. Click to expand your Confluent cluster schema - its name should match the ID of your Confluent Cloud kafka cluster
6. Verify that you see three tables: *clickstream*, *denormalized_hotel_bookings*, and *hotel_stats*

   ![Expanded Catalog schema](./images/databricks_catalog_cluster_schema.png)

7. Select the *denormalized_hotel_bookings* table
8. Click the **Create** dropdown button in the top right of the screen
9. Select **Query** from the dropdown list
10. In the SQL editor, run this query to see if data is available

```sql
SELECT * FROM clickstream LIMIT 20;
```

You should see 20 records of clickstream data.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot here of clickstream -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **10-15 Minute Data Sync**
>
> It may take 5-10 minutes for the `SELECT` queries to return data for the `denormalized_hotel_bookings` and
> `hotel_stats` tables, as you may have only recently enabled them with TableFlow.
>

### Step 2: Derive Data Product Insights with Genie

Databricks Genie makes it more accessible and easier to obtain data insights.  It provides a chat interface where you ask questions about your data in natural language, and it leverages generative AI to parse your questions and answer them through SQL queries it generates.

#### Set Up Genie Workspace

Follow these steps to set Genie up:

1. Click on the **Genie** link under the *SQL* section in the left sidebar
2. Click on the **+ New** button in the top right of the screen to create a new Genie space
3. Click on the **All** toggle
4. Navigate to your workshop *catalog* and *database* (e.g. `****-tableflow-databricks-****` and `lkc-****`)
5. Select all three of the `clickstream`, `denormalized_hotel_bookings`, and `hotel_stats` tables

   ![Databricks Genie connect to data sources](images/databricks_genie_connect_data.png)

6. Click on the **Create** button
7. Rename your space to something like *River Hotel BI*
8. Your space should look similar to this:

   ![Databricks Genie space](images/databricks_genie_space.png)

#### Generate Business Insights

Prompt Genie for insights about the data using natural language and following these steps:

> [!NOTE]
> **Example Screenshots**
>
> Throughout these next steps of prompting insights from Genie, the results depicted in the screenshots are **only examples** - the dataset
> you generate for this lab is different each time, and so these example screenshots will never fully match what you see.

Click the **Explain the data set** button to generate an output similar to this:

![Databricks Genie prompt to explain data set](images/databricks_genie_prompt_explain_dataset.png)

Now, find out how each country is doing with customer satisfaction with this prompt:
> Show me customer satisfaction metrics by country

You may see a table and chart similar to this:
![Databricks Genie sample user prompt](images/databricks_genie_prompt_satisfaction_by_country.png)

You can dive into customer-centric analysis with this prompt:
> Show me customers who viewed hotels in the most cities

You should see a result similar to this:

![Table of customers](images/databricks_genie_prompt_customers_hotels_viewed.png)

Another prompt to try out is this:
> Which cities had the most interest from customers?

See which cities top your list, it may look similar to this:

![table and chart of cities with the most interest](images/databricks_genie_prompt_cities_customer_interest.png)

You may continue with your own prompts or clicking on Genie-suggested ones to further learn from the data.

Executing this final prompt will provide the *class* of hotel that you will use to fulfill the targeted Marketing campaign:

> Which class of hotel had the lowest interest from customers?

![Result set showing hotel class and corresponding customer interest count](images/databricks_genie_prompt_hotel_class.png)

Identify the *Hotel Class* with the lowest customer interest, you will use this in the next section to create an intelligent marketing agent.

### Step 3: Create and Deploy Marketing Campaign Agent

In this section you will use a provided Jupyter Notebook to generate an AI agent that will identify hotels that need promotion and create targeted marketing campaigns for them!

The AI agent combines three intelligent functions:

1. **Hotel Selection**: Identifies the lowest-performing hotel in a given class that has above-average customer satisfaction (3+ reviews) - perfect candidates for promotion
2. **Content Generation**: Leverages AI to analyze customer reviews and extract the top 3 reasons guests enjoyed their stay, then creates positive social media posts highlighting these strengths
3. **Customer Targeting**: Uncovers customers who showed high interest (many page views/clicks) but made few bookings in that hotel class - prime targets for conversion

This diagram shows a detailed flow of the notebook:

3. Select it and start chatting with your agent!

4. Try these example prompts:
   - "Which hotel should we create a marketing campaign for in the Airport class?"
   - "Find the best hotel to promote in the Luxury class"
   - "Create a targeted campaign for Extended Stay hotels"

5. Your agent will automatically:
   - Identify an underperforming hotel with good reviews
   - Generate a positive marketing post based on customer reviews
   - Provide a list of target customers

**Congratulations!** Your AI marketing agent is now deployed and accessible through multiple interfaces:
