# Flink Streaming Joins with CDC Sources: A Journey of Discovery

## üéØ Overview

This document chronicles our journey in solving complex streaming join challenges when working with Oracle CDC sources in Confluent Cloud Flink. What started as a straightforward temporal join implementation evolved into a comprehensive exploration of streaming join patterns, revealing important insights about CDC compatibility and optimal strategies for real-time data processing.

## üìñ The Journey: From Problem to Solution

### üö® **Chapter 1: The Initial Challenge**

**The Goal**: Create a denormalized view by joining streaming bookings with customer and hotel dimension data from Oracle CDC sources.

**The Expectation**: Use temporal joins (`FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF`) for proper versioned table semantics.

**The Reality**: Immediate failure with primary key detection errors.

**Error Encountered**:
```text
Temporal Table Join requires primary key in versioned table, but no primary key can be found.
```

### üîç **Chapter 2: The Investigation**

Our systematic investigation revealed all the "usual suspects" were correctly configured:

#### ‚úÖ **Infrastructure Validation**

**Oracle Database Primary Keys**: Perfect
- **CUSTOMER table**: Primary key on `EMAIL` column ‚úÖ
- **HOTEL table**: Primary key on `HOTEL_ID` column ‚úÖ

```sql
-- Confirmed proper primary key constraints
DESCRIBE SAMPLE.CUSTOMER;  -- EMAIL: NOT NULL VARCHAR2(255)
DESCRIBE SAMPLE.HOTEL;     -- HOTEL_ID: NOT NULL VARCHAR2(255)
```

**Kafka Topic Configuration**: Perfect
- **`riverhotel.SAMPLE.CUSTOMER`**: `cleanup.policy=compact` ‚úÖ
- **`riverhotel.SAMPLE.HOTEL`**: `cleanup.policy=compact` ‚úÖ

**Oracle XStream Connector**: Working Correctly
- Primary key metadata successfully captured (evidenced by `DISTRIBUTED BY HASH`)
- CDC operations flowing properly to Kafka topics

### üß™ **Chapter 3: The Experimentation Phase**

With infrastructure confirmed correct, we embarked on extensive testing to understand the fundamental compatibility issues.

#### üß™ **Experiment 1: Temporal Joins with Primary Key Declaration**

**Hypothesis**: Maybe Flink needs explicit primary key declaration even when connector captures metadata.

```sql
-- Attempt: Declare primary keys explicitly
ALTER TABLE `riverhotel.SAMPLE.CUSTOMER` ADD PRIMARY KEY (`EMAIL`) NOT ENFORCED;
ALTER TABLE `riverhotel.SAMPLE.HOTEL` ADD PRIMARY KEY (`HOTEL_ID`) NOT ENFORCED;

-- Test temporal join
SELECT ... FROM `bookings` b
JOIN `riverhotel.SAMPLE.CUSTOMER` FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF b.`$rowtime` AS c
  ON c.`EMAIL` = b.`CUSTOMER_EMAIL`
LIMIT 5;
```

**Result**: Query executed successfully but returned **ZERO rows** üö´

**Learning**: Temporal joins accept the syntax but fail to return expected results with CDC sources.

#### üß™ **Experiment 2: Temporal Joins with Time Buffers**

**Hypothesis**: CDC timing issues might require time buffers to account for processing delays.

```sql
-- Attempt: Add time buffer for CDC processing
SELECT ... FROM `bookings` b
JOIN `riverhotel.SAMPLE.CUSTOMER` FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF (b.`$rowtime` + INTERVAL '5' MINUTE) AS c
  ON c.`EMAIL` = b.`CUSTOMER_EMAIL`
```

**Result**: **Syntax Error** üö´
```text
Error: "Temporal table join currently only supports 'FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF' left table's time attribute field"
```

**Learning**: Flink temporal joins are rigid - no expressions allowed in time specification.

#### üß™ **Experiment 3: Current Timestamp Fallback**

**Hypothesis**: Use current timestamp to get latest CDC state.

```sql
-- Attempt: Use current data state
SELECT ... FROM `bookings` b
JOIN `riverhotel.SAMPLE.CUSTOMER` FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS c
  ON c.`EMAIL` = b.`CUSTOMER_EMAIL`
```

**Result**: **Internal Error** üö´
```text
Error: "Internal error occurred"
```

**Learning**: Even fallback approaches cause system failures in this environment.

#### ‚úÖ **Experiment 4: Regular Join Sanity Check**

**Hypothesis**: Verify the data actually exists and can be joined.

```sql
-- Sanity check: Regular join without temporal semantics
SELECT ... FROM `bookings` b
JOIN `riverhotel.SAMPLE.CUSTOMER` c ON c.`EMAIL` = b.`CUSTOMER_EMAIL`
LIMIT 10;
```

**Result**: **Multiple rows returned successfully** ‚úÖ

**Learning**: Data exists, keys match, regular joins work perfectly - the issue is specifically with temporal join mechanics.

### üí° **Chapter 4: The Breakthrough Discovery**

After extensive experimentation, we discovered the fundamental issue wasn't configuration but **stream semantics compatibility**.

#### üîç **The Core Insight: CDC Stream Types vs Join Requirements**

**The Revelation**: Different Flink join types have different stream compatibility requirements:

| Join Type | Input Stream Support | Primary Key Requirement | Time Window Support |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Temporal Joins** | ‚úÖ CDC Changelog | ‚úÖ Explicit declaration required | ‚ùå Fixed point-in-time |
| **Interval Joins** | ‚ùå Append-only ONLY | ‚ùå Not required | ‚úÖ Flexible time windows |
| **Regular Joins** | ‚úÖ CDC Changelog | ‚ùå Not required | ‚ùå Unbounded state |

**The Problem**: CDC sources produce **changelog streams** (`INSERT`, `UPDATE_BEFORE`, `UPDATE_AFTER`, `DELETE`), but:
- **Temporal joins** in this environment have versioned table state issues
- **Interval joins** explicitly reject changelog streams
- **Regular joins** create unbounded state (not suitable for production)

**Error Proof**:
```text
StreamPhysicalIntervalJoin doesn't support consuming update and delete changes
```

#### üß™ **Experiment 5: Interval Joins with CDC (The Failure)**

**Attempt**: Try interval joins directly with CDC sources for time-windowed joining.

```sql
-- This FAILS with CDC sources
SELECT ... FROM `bookings` b
JOIN `riverhotel.SAMPLE.CUSTOMER` c
  ON c.`EMAIL` = b.`CUSTOMER_EMAIL`
  AND c.`$rowtime` BETWEEN b.`$rowtime` - INTERVAL '1' DAY AND b.`$rowtime` + INTERVAL '1' DAY
```

**Result**: **Error** üö´
```text
StreamPhysicalIntervalJoin doesn't support consuming update and delete changes
```

**Learning**: Interval joins provide time windows we need but reject CDC changelog streams.

### üöÄ **Chapter 5: The Solution Evolution**

#### **Breakthrough Idea**: Convert CDC Changelog ‚Üí Append-Only Snapshots

**The Strategy**: Create snapshot tables that capture the current state from CDC sources in append-only format, then use interval joins on those snapshots.

**Why This Works**:
- ‚úÖ **Converts changelog ‚Üí append-only** for interval join compatibility
- ‚úÖ **Captures current state** sufficient for most analytical use cases
- ‚úÖ **Enables time windows** through interval joins
- ‚úÖ **Bounded state management** prevents memory issues
- ‚úÖ **Handles CDC timing** gracefully with configurable time windows

#### üß™ **Experiment 6: Snapshot Tables + Interval Joins (The Success)**

**Implementation**: Create append-only snapshots from CDC sources, then use interval joins.

**Step 1**: Create snapshot tables
```sql
-- Create append-only customer snapshot
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER_SNAPSHOT AS (
SELECT CUSTOMER_ID, EMAIL, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, BIRTH_DATE, CREATED_AT
FROM `riverhotel.SAMPLE.CUSTOMER`
);

-- Force append-only mode (overrides inherited CDC changelog mode)
ALTER TABLE CUSTOMER_SNAPSHOT SET ('changelog.mode' = 'append');
```

**Step 2**: Test interval joins with snapshots
```sql
-- This WORKS: Snapshots are append-only compatible
SELECT ... FROM `bookings` b
JOIN `CUSTOMER_SNAPSHOT` c
  ON c.`EMAIL` = b.`CUSTOMER_EMAIL`
  AND c.`$rowtime` BETWEEN b.`$rowtime` - INTERVAL '7' DAY AND b.`$rowtime` + INTERVAL '7' DAY
LIMIT 10;
```

**Result**: **Success! Multiple rows returned** ‚úÖ

**Key Discovery**: The `ALTER TABLE ... SET ('changelog.mode' = 'append')` was crucial because snapshot tables inherit changelog semantics from CDC sources.

## üéØ **Chapter 6: The Final Solution**

Our journey led to a sophisticated **hybrid timestamp strategy** that combines the best of both processing-time and business-time semantics:

### **The Hybrid Approach**: Different Timestamps for Different Join Types

```sql
-- ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Use $rowtime for dimensions, CREATED_AT for events
FROM `bookings` b
   -- Use $rowtime for dimension joins (data availability)
   JOIN `CUSTOMER_SNAPSHOT` c
     ON c.`EMAIL` = b.`CUSTOMER_EMAIL`
     AND c.`$rowtime` BETWEEN b.`$rowtime` - INTERVAL '7' DAY AND b.`$rowtime` + INTERVAL '7' DAY
   JOIN `HOTEL_SNAPSHOT` h
     ON h.`HOTEL_ID` = b.`HOTEL_ID`
     AND h.`$rowtime` BETWEEN b.`$rowtime` - INTERVAL '7' DAY AND b.`$rowtime` + INTERVAL '7' DAY
   -- Use CREATED_AT for business logic joins (realistic timing)
   LEFT JOIN `hotel_reviews` hr
     ON hr.`BOOKING_ID` = b.`BOOKING_ID`
     AND to_timestamp_ltz(hr.`CREATED_AT`, 3) BETWEEN
         to_timestamp_ltz(b.`CREATED_AT`, 3) AND
         to_timestamp_ltz(b.`CREATED_AT`, 3) + INTERVAL '90' DAY
```

### **Why This Hybrid Strategy Works**

#### **`$rowtime` for Dimensions** (Customer/Hotel Data)
- **Purpose**: Ensures dimension data was available when booking was processed
- **Window**: Short (7 days) - dimensions change infrequently
- **Semantics**: "Find customer/hotel data as it existed around processing time"
- **Handles**: CDC processing delays and ordering issues

#### **`CREATED_AT` for Events** (Reviews)
- **Purpose**: Reflects realistic business timing relationships
- **Window**: Longer (90 days) - events can happen over extended periods
- **Semantics**: "Find reviews created within 90 days after booking was made"
- **Handles**: Business logic requirements and user behavior patterns

### **Results Comparison**

| Approach | Records Returned | Why |
|----------|------------------|-----|
| **All `$rowtime`** | 100 records | Artificial filtering based on processing order |
| **All `CREATED_AT`** | Varies | May miss dimension data due to processing delays |
| **Hybrid Strategy** | **420 records** | ‚úÖ All bookings with proper review timing |

```sql
-- Step 1: Create snapshot tables from CDC sources
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER_SNAPSHOT AS (
SELECT CUSTOMER_ID, EMAIL, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, BIRTH_DATE, CREATED_AT
FROM `riverhotel.SAMPLE.CUSTOMER`
);
ALTER TABLE CUSTOMER_SNAPSHOT SET ('changelog.mode' = 'append');

CREATE TABLE HOTEL_SNAPSHOT AS (
SELECT HOTEL_ID, NAME, CLASS, DESCRIPTION, CITY, COUNTRY, ROOM_CAPACITY, CREATED_AT
FROM `riverhotel.SAMPLE.HOTEL`
);
ALTER TABLE HOTEL_SNAPSHOT SET ('changelog.mode' = 'append');

-- Step 2: Create denormalized view with hybrid timestamp strategy
SET 'client.statement-name' = 'denormalized-hotel-bookings';
CREATE TABLE DENORMALIZED_HOTEL_BOOKINGS AS (
SELECT
  h.`NAME` AS `HOTEL_NAME`,
  h.`DESCRIPTION` AS `HOTEL_DESCRIPTION`,
  h.`CLASS` AS `HOTEL_CLASS`,
  h.`CITY` AS `HOTEL_CITY`,
  h.`COUNTRY` AS `HOTEL_COUNTRY`,
  b.`PRICE` AS `BOOKING_AMOUNT`,
  b.`OCCUPANTS` AS `GUEST_COUNT`,
  to_timestamp_ltz(b.`CREATED_AT`, 3) AS `BOOKING_DATE`,
  to_timestamp_ltz(b.`CHECK_IN`, 3) AS `CHECK_IN`,
  to_timestamp_ltz(b.`CHECK_OUT`, 3) AS `CHECK_OUT`,
  c.`EMAIL` AS `CUSTOMER_EMAIL`,
  c.`FIRST_NAME` AS `CUSTOMER_FIRST_NAME`,
  hr.`REVIEW_RATING`,
  hr.`REVIEW_TEXT`,
  to_timestamp_ltz(hr.`CREATED_AT`, 3) AS `REVIEW_DATE`,
  b.`BOOKING_ID`,
  h.`HOTEL_ID`
FROM `bookings` b
   -- $rowtime for dimension joins (data availability)
   JOIN `CUSTOMER_SNAPSHOT` c
     ON c.`EMAIL` = b.`CUSTOMER_EMAIL`
     AND c.`$rowtime` BETWEEN b.`$rowtime` - INTERVAL '7' DAY AND b.`$rowtime` + INTERVAL '7' DAY
   JOIN `HOTEL_SNAPSHOT` h
     ON h.`HOTEL_ID` = b.`HOTEL_ID`
     AND h.`$rowtime` BETWEEN b.`$rowtime` - INTERVAL '7' DAY AND b.`$rowtime` + INTERVAL '7' DAY
   -- CREATED_AT for business logic joins (realistic timing)
   LEFT JOIN `hotel_reviews` hr
     ON hr.`BOOKING_ID` = b.`BOOKING_ID`
     AND to_timestamp_ltz(hr.`CREATED_AT`, 3) BETWEEN
         to_timestamp_ltz(b.`CREATED_AT`, 3) AND
         to_timestamp_ltz(b.`CREATED_AT`, 3) + INTERVAL '90' DAY
);
```

## üìö **Chapter 7: Key Learnings and Insights**

Our journey revealed several crucial insights about streaming joins with CDC sources:

### **üîç Technical Discoveries**

#### **1. Stream Semantics Matter More Than Configuration**
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure was perfect**: Oracle PKs, Kafka compaction, connector metadata
- ‚ùå **Stream compatibility was the issue**: CDC changelog vs join requirements
- üí° **Lesson**: Focus on stream semantics, not just configuration

#### **2. Join Type Selection is Critical**
```sql
-- ‚ùå Temporal joins: Theoretically correct but practically unreliable
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF b.$rowtime

-- ‚ùå Regular joins: Unbounded state, memory issues
JOIN table ON condition

-- ‚úÖ Interval joins + snapshots: Bounded state, reliable, flexible
JOIN snapshot ON condition AND time_window_condition
```

#### **3. Changelog Mode Inheritance**
- **Discovery**: `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` from CDC sources inherits changelog semantics
- **Solution**: Explicit `ALTER TABLE ... SET ('changelog.mode' = 'append')`
- **Impact**: Critical for interval join compatibility

#### **4. Hybrid Timestamp Strategies**
- **Processing time** (`$rowtime`): Data availability guarantees
- **Business time** (`CREATED_AT`): Realistic business logic
- **Hybrid approach**: Combines both for optimal results

### **üéØ Practical Recommendations**

#### **For Workshop/Educational Contexts**
- ‚úÖ **Use snapshot + interval joins**: Reliable, educational value high
- ‚úÖ **Focus on business outcomes**: Don't get stuck on theoretical perfection
- ‚úÖ **Document journey**: Troubleshooting becomes learning opportunity

#### **For Production Systems**
- ‚úÖ **Start with snapshot approach**: Proven reliable with CDC sources
- üü° **Consider temporal joins**: Test thoroughly in your specific environment
- ‚úÖ **Monitor performance**: Validate time window sizes for your data patterns

#### **For Complex Join Scenarios**
- ‚úÖ **Use hybrid timestamp strategies**: Processing time + business time
- ‚úÖ **Size windows appropriately**: Dimensions (hours/days), events (days/months)
- ‚úÖ **Test with realistic data volumes**: Performance varies significantly

## üéØ **Chapter 8: Final Recommendations by Use Case**

### **üìö Educational/Workshop Context**
```sql
-- RECOMMENDED: Snapshot + interval joins
CREATE TABLE SNAPSHOT AS (SELECT ... FROM CDC_SOURCE);
ALTER TABLE SNAPSHOT SET ('changelog.mode' = 'append');
-- Then use interval joins with appropriate time windows
```
**Why**: Reliable, teaches important streaming concepts, always works

### **üè≠ Production Context**
```sql
-- OPTION 1: Snapshot approach (most reliable)
-- Same as above but with production-tuned time windows

-- OPTION 2: Temporal joins (test first)
ALTER TABLE CDC_SOURCE ADD PRIMARY KEY (...) NOT ENFORCED;
-- Then test thoroughly with your data patterns
```
**Why**: Balance reliability with real-time requirements

### **üî¨ Research/Experimentation Context**
- Try temporal joins first
- Fall back to snapshots if issues arise
- Document compatibility findings for your environment

## üîß **Appendix: Advanced Techniques**

### **A1: Changelog Mode Inheritance**

**Key Discovery**: Snapshot tables inherit CDC changelog semantics and must be explicitly converted:

```sql
-- ‚ùå This inherits changelog.mode = 'upsert' from CDC source
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER_SNAPSHOT AS (SELECT ... FROM CDC_SOURCE);

-- ‚úÖ Must explicitly set append mode for interval join compatibility
ALTER TABLE CUSTOMER_SNAPSHOT SET ('changelog.mode' = 'append');
```

### **A2: Alternative Approaches Tested**

| Approach | Result | Learning |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Temporal + PK Declaration** | ‚ùå 0 rows | Syntax works, no results |
| **Temporal + Time Buffer** | ‚ùå Syntax Error | Expressions not supported |
| **Temporal + CURRENT_TIMESTAMP** | ‚ùå Internal Error | System incompatibility |
| **Regular Joins** | ‚úÖ Works | Confirms data exists |
| **Snapshot + Interval** | ‚úÖ 420 rows | Production solution |

### **A3: Schema Definition Approaches for Nullable Columns**

### Problem Context

When creating aggregate tables in Flink SQL, you may encounter primary key errors due to nullable columns:

> Invalid primary key 'PK_HOTEL_ID_HOTEL_NAME_HOTEL_CITY_HOTEL_COUNTRY_HOTEL_DESCRIPTION'.
> Column 'HOTEL_NAME' is nullable.

This occurs because Flink auto-infers primary keys from `GROUP BY` columns, but cannot create primary keys from nullable columns.

### Approach 1: COALESCE (Recommended for Workshops)

**Quick null handling in aggregation queries:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE AGGREGATE_HOTEL_REVIEWS AS (
   SELECT
      COALESCE(HOTEL_ID, 'UNKNOWN_HOTEL') AS HOTEL_ID,
      COALESCE(HOTEL_NAME, 'UNKNOWN_NAME') AS HOTEL_NAME,
      COALESCE(HOTEL_CITY, 'UNKNOWN_CITY') AS HOTEL_CITY,
      COALESCE(HOTEL_COUNTRY, 'UNKNOWN_COUNTRY') AS HOTEL_COUNTRY,
      COALESCE(HOTEL_DESCRIPTION, 'NO_DESCRIPTION') AS HOTEL_DESCRIPTION,
      AVG(REVIEW_RATING) AS AVERAGE_REVIEW_RATING,
      COUNT(REVIEW_RATING) AS REVIEW_COUNT,
      ARRAY_JOIN(ARRAY_AGG(REVIEW_TEXT), '||| ') AS HOTEL_REVIEWS
   FROM DENORMALIZED_HOTEL_BOOKINGS
   GROUP BY COALESCE(HOTEL_ID, 'UNKNOWN_HOTEL'),
      COALESCE(HOTEL_NAME, 'UNKNOWN_NAME'),
      COALESCE(HOTEL_CITY, 'UNKNOWN_CITY'),
      COALESCE(HOTEL_COUNTRY, 'UNKNOWN_COUNTRY'),
      COALESCE(HOTEL_DESCRIPTION, 'NO_DESCRIPTION')
);
```

‚úÖ **Benefits**: Simple, works with any schema, immediate implementation
‚ùå **Drawbacks**: Verbose, runtime overhead

### Approach 2: Explicit Schema Definition (Production)

**Define table structure before inserting data:**

```sql
-- Step 1: Define exact schema with constraints
CREATE TABLE DENORMALIZED_HOTEL_BOOKINGS (
  HOTEL_NAME VARCHAR NOT NULL,           -- Explicitly non-nullable
  HOTEL_DESCRIPTION VARCHAR NOT NULL,    -- Explicitly non-nullable
  HOTEL_CLASS VARCHAR,                   -- Nullable (optional)
  HOTEL_CITY VARCHAR NOT NULL,           -- Explicitly non-nullable
  HOTEL_COUNTRY VARCHAR NOT NULL,        -- Explicitly non-nullable
  BOOKING_AMOUNT DECIMAL(10,2),
  GUEST_COUNT INT,
  BOOKING_DATE TIMESTAMP(3),
  CHECK_IN TIMESTAMP(3),
  CHECK_OUT TIMESTAMP(3),
  CUSTOMER_EMAIL VARCHAR,
  CUSTOMER_FIRST_NAME VARCHAR,
  REVIEW_RATING INT,
  REVIEW_TEXT STRING,
  REVIEW_DATE TIMESTAMP(3),
  BOOKING_ID VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  HOTEL_ID VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (BOOKING_ID, HOTEL_ID) NOT ENFORCED  -- Explicit PK
);

-- Step 2: Insert data with COALESCE to meet NOT NULL constraints
INSERT INTO DENORMALIZED_HOTEL_BOOKINGS
SELECT
  COALESCE(h.NAME, 'UNKNOWN_NAME') AS HOTEL_NAME,     -- Converts nulls to defaults
  COALESCE(h.DESCRIPTION, 'NO_DESCRIPTION') AS HOTEL_DESCRIPTION,
  h.CLASS AS HOTEL_CLASS,                             -- Allows nulls
  COALESCE(h.CITY, 'UNKNOWN_CITY') AS HOTEL_CITY,
  COALESCE(h.COUNTRY, 'UNKNOWN_COUNTRY') AS HOTEL_COUNTRY,
  b.PRICE AS BOOKING_AMOUNT,
  b.OCCUPANTS AS GUEST_COUNT,
  to_timestamp_ltz(b.CREATED_AT, 3) AS BOOKING_DATE,
  to_timestamp_ltz(b.CHECK_IN, 3) AS CHECK_IN,
  to_timestamp_ltz(b.CHECK_OUT, 3) AS CHECK_OUT,
  c.EMAIL AS CUSTOMER_EMAIL,
  c.FIRST_NAME AS CUSTOMER_FIRST_NAME,
  hr.REVIEW_RATING,
  hr.REVIEW_TEXT,
  to_timestamp_ltz(hr.CREATED_AT, 3) AS REVIEW_DATE,
  b.BOOKING_ID,
  h.HOTEL_ID
FROM bookings b
  JOIN CUSTOMER_SNAPSHOT c
    ON c.EMAIL = b.CUSTOMER_EMAIL
    AND c.$rowtime BETWEEN b.$rowtime - INTERVAL '1' DAY AND b.$rowtime + INTERVAL '1' DAY
  JOIN HOTEL_SNAPSHOT h
    ON h.HOTEL_ID = b.HOTEL_ID
    AND h.$rowtime BETWEEN b.$rowtime - INTERVAL '1' DAY AND b.$rowtime + INTERVAL '1' DAY
  LEFT JOIN hotel_reviews hr
    ON hr.BOOKING_ID = b.BOOKING_ID
    AND hr.$rowtime BETWEEN b.$rowtime AND b.$rowtime + INTERVAL '90' DAY;

-- Step 3: Subsequent aggregates work without COALESCE
CREATE TABLE AGGREGATE_HOTEL_REVIEWS AS (
   SELECT
      HOTEL_ID,                           -- No COALESCE needed!
      HOTEL_NAME,                         -- No COALESCE needed!
      HOTEL_CITY,                         -- No COALESCE needed!
      HOTEL_COUNTRY,                      -- No COALESCE needed!
      HOTEL_DESCRIPTION,                  -- No COALESCE needed!
      AVG(REVIEW_RATING) AS AVERAGE_REVIEW_RATING,
      COUNT(REVIEW_RATING) AS REVIEW_COUNT,
      ARRAY_JOIN(ARRAY_AGG(REVIEW_TEXT), '||| ') AS HOTEL_REVIEWS
   FROM DENORMALIZED_HOTEL_BOOKINGS
   GROUP BY HOTEL_ID, HOTEL_NAME, HOTEL_CITY, HOTEL_COUNTRY, HOTEL_DESCRIPTION
);
```

‚úÖ **Benefits**:

- **Explicit schema control**: Full control over column types and nullability
- **No COALESCE needed in aggregates**: Subsequent GROUP BY queries work without null handling
- **Clear data contracts**: Schema explicitly documents expected data structure
- **Production ready**: Better for production environments with strict data governance

‚ùå **Drawbacks**: More initial setup required

### Approach 3: Source Table Constraints

**Modify source snapshot tables to enforce NOT NULL:**

```sql
-- After creating HOTEL_SNAPSHOT, add constraints
ALTER TABLE HOTEL_SNAPSHOT MODIFY (
  HOTEL_ID VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  NAME VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  CITY VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  COUNTRY VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  DESCRIPTION VARCHAR NOT NULL
);

-- After creating CUSTOMER_SNAPSHOT, add constraints
ALTER TABLE CUSTOMER_SNAPSHOT MODIFY (
  EMAIL VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  FIRST_NAME VARCHAR NOT NULL
);
```

This ensures that joined results inherit the NOT NULL constraints.

‚úÖ **Benefits**: Upstream data quality enforcement
‚ùå **Drawbacks**: May fail if actual nulls exist in source data

### üìã When to Use Each Approach

| Approach | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|------|------|
| **COALESCE** | Quick fixes, prototyping, workshops | Simple, works with any schema | Verbose, runtime overhead |
| **Explicit Schema** | Production, strict governance | Clean aggregates, clear contracts | More initial setup |
| **Source Constraints** | When you control source data | Upstream data quality | May fail if actual nulls exist |

### üéØ How Flink Determines Nullability

Flink determines source field nullability through multiple mechanisms:

#### 1. Source Connector Metadata

```sql
-- Oracle table definition
CREATE TABLE hotel (
  HOTEL_ID VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  NAME VARCHAR2(500),                    -- No NOT NULL constraint
  CITY VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL
);
```

Flink inherits:

- `HOTEL_ID`: NOT NULL ‚úÖ
- `NAME`: **NULLABLE** ‚ùå (because Oracle allows NULL)
- `CITY`: NOT NULL ‚úÖ

#### 2. CDC Stream Characteristics

Even if Oracle column is NOT NULL, CDC can introduce nullability:

```sql
UPDATE hotel SET name = NULL WHERE hotel_id = 'H123';  -- Now NAME is null
```

CDC streams carry these operations, so Flink **conservatively assumes nullable** for CDC sources.

#### 3. Conservative Default

When in doubt, **Flink defaults to nullable** for safety:

- Better to allow nulls when not needed
- Than to reject valid null data

### üí° Recommendation

- **For workshops/prototyping**: Use COALESCE approach for immediate results
- **For production environments**: Use explicit schema definition for clean, maintainable code
- **For source-controlled data**: Consider source table constraints

### **A4: Hybrid Timestamp Strategy for Complex Joins**

### Problem: When to Use `$rowtime` vs `CREATED_AT`

In complex joins involving both **dimension data** (customers, hotels) and **event data** (reviews), choosing the right timestamp strategy is crucial:

### ‚úÖ **Recommended Hybrid Approach**

```sql
FROM `bookings` b
   -- Use $rowtime for dimension joins (data availability)
   JOIN `CUSTOMER_SNAPSHOT` c
     ON c.`EMAIL` = b.`CUSTOMER_EMAIL`
     AND c.`$rowtime` BETWEEN b.`$rowtime` - INTERVAL '7' DAY AND b.`$rowtime` + INTERVAL '7' DAY
   JOIN `HOTEL_SNAPSHOT` h
     ON h.`HOTEL_ID` = b.`HOTEL_ID`
     AND h.`$rowtime` BETWEEN b.`$rowtime` - INTERVAL '7' DAY AND b.`$rowtime` + INTERVAL '7' DAY
   -- Use CREATED_AT for business logic joins (realistic timing)
   LEFT JOIN `hotel_reviews` hr
     ON hr.`BOOKING_ID` = b.`BOOKING_ID`
     AND to_timestamp_ltz(hr.`CREATED_AT`, 3) BETWEEN
         to_timestamp_ltz(b.`CREATED_AT`, 3) AND
         to_timestamp_ltz(b.`CREATED_AT`, 3) + INTERVAL '90' DAY
```

### üîç **Why This Works**

#### **`$rowtime` for Dimensions**

- **Purpose**: Ensures dimension data was available when booking was processed
- **Window**: Short (7 days) - dimensions change infrequently
- **Semantics**: "Find customer/hotel data as it existed around processing time"

#### **`CREATED_AT` for Events**

- **Purpose**: Reflects realistic business timing relationships
- **Window**: Longer (90 days) - events can happen over extended periods
- **Semantics**: "Find reviews created within 90 days after booking was made"

### üìä **Results Comparison**

| Approach | Records Returned | Explanation |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| **All `$rowtime`** | 100 records | Artificial filtering based on processing order |
| **All `CREATED_AT`** | Varies | May miss dimension data due to processing delays |
| **Hybrid Strategy** | **420 records** | ‚úÖ All bookings with proper review timing |

### üí° **Best Practice**

Use **hybrid timestamp strategies** when:

- ‚úÖ Joining stable dimension data (customers, products, locations)
- ‚úÖ Joining time-sensitive event data (reviews, transactions, clicks)
- ‚úÖ You need both processing-time and business-time semantics
- ‚úÖ Complex multi-table joins with different timing requirements
