## üìù Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style and Standards

#### **Terraform**

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Include comments for complex resource configurations
- Follow [Terraform best practices](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/best-practices)
- Use meaningful resource names with consistent naming conventions
- Include appropriate tags for cloud resources

```hcl
# Good example
resource "aws_instance" "oracle_instance" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.oracle_linux.id
  instance_type = var.oracle_instance_type

  tags = {
    Name        = "${local.resource_prefix}-oracle-instance"
    Environment = var.environment
    Workshop    = "tableflow-databricks"
  }

  # Configure Oracle XE for workshop
  user_data = templatefile("${path.module}/scripts/oracle-setup.sh", {
    admin_password = var.oracle_admin_password
  })
}
```

#### **Documentation**

- Use clear, concise language appropriate for intermediate-level learners
- Include step-by-step instructions with expected outcomes
- Add screenshots for complex UI interactions (update `images/`)
- Use consistent Markdown formatting
- Include code blocks with proper syntax highlighting

#### **SQL Queries**

- Use consistent indentation and formatting
- Include comments explaining complex logic
- Use meaningful aliases and table names
- Follow SQL best practices for readability

```sql
-- Create denormalized booking data with interval joins
SET 'client.statement-name' = 'denormalized-hotel-bookings';

CREATE TABLE DENORMALIZED_HOTEL_BOOKINGS AS (
  SELECT
    h.`NAME` AS `HOTEL_NAME`,
    h.`DESCRIPTION` AS `HOTEL_DESCRIPTION`,
    h.`CLASS` AS `HOTEL_CLASS`,
    -- Convert epoch timestamps to readable format
    to_timestamp_ltz(b.`CREATED_AT`, 3) AS `BOOKING_DATE`,
    b.`BOOKING_ID`
  FROM `bookings` b
    -- Interval join with snapshot table for CDC compatibility
    JOIN `CUSTOMER_SNAPSHOT` c
      ON c.`EMAIL` = b.`CUSTOMER_EMAIL`
      AND c.`$rowtime` BETWEEN b.`$rowtime` - INTERVAL '7' DAY AND b.`$rowtime` + INTERVAL '7' DAY
);
```

### Testing Requirements

#### **Infrastructure Testing**

1. **Pre-deployment validation**:

   ```bash

   - Verify all resources deploy successfully
   - Validate connectivity between components
   - Test teardown process (`terraform destroy`)

3. **Workshop flow testing**:
   - Follow lab instructions step-by-step
   - Verify expected outputs and results
   - Test troubleshooting scenarios

#### **Documentation Testing**
